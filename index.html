		<h2> About Tohru </h2>
			<p>Tohru Honda is the portagonist of Fruits Basket, a slice of life, romance and comdedy anime. Always the bright and cheerful girl, Tohru does her best to make the best of everything. She's my comfort character as her constant battle with self-guilt and
				her kindness is somnehow relatable. Tohru goes too hard on herself and eventually learns it's okay to be "selfish" and love someone</p>
