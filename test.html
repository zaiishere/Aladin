	<p>Aladin is the perfect example of "innocence" and how human beings are naturally inclined to do goodness. He was raised isolated with a
	genie. He never saw a <b>Single person</b> till 10 years old.</p>

	<p>Aladin remains strong for his friends because he is too lonely. He doesn't want to be alone. But he is overly attached to his king candidate: <br> Alibaba</p>
